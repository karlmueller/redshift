Purpose and function of cooling.cpp
1) get the temperature of the joint and main nodes
2) vary fan voltage likely [0, 5]V to accomodate for cooling
--> method to determine steady state cooling performance? Can we create a trasnfer fucntion based on the ventilation and the wattage expected?
--> can determine rough running, stall motor power in lab and add this in. Know how large the ventiation holes are
--> any accomodation for generated noise?
